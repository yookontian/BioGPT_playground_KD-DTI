# BioGPT
This repository contains the implementation of [BioGPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer for Biomedical Text Generation and Mining](https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbac409/6713511?guestAccessKey=a66d9b5d-4f83-4017-bb52-405815c907b9), by Renqian Luo, Liai Sun, Yingce Xia, Tao Qin, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon and Tie-Yan Liu.

# News!
* BioGPT-Large model with 1.5B parameters is coming, currently available on PubMedQA task with SOTA performance of 81% accuracy. See [Question Answering on PubMedQA](examples/QA-PubMedQA/) for evaluation.


# Requirements and Installation

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version == 1.12.0
* Python version == 3.10
* fairseq version == 0.12.0:

Fairseq, a sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language modeling and other text generation tasks
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
git checkout v0.12.0
pip install .
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ..
```
* Moses
Moses, a statistical machine translation system that allows you to automatically train translation models for any language pair
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder.git
export MOSES=${PWD}/mosesdecoder
```
* fastBPE
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/glample/fastBPE.git
export FASTBPE=${PWD}/fastBPE
cd fastBPE
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -O3 fastBPE/main.cc -IfastBPE -o fast
```
This command is for compiling the C++ code of fastBPE using g++, a GNU compiler for C and C++Â¹. The command has several options that specify different aspects of the compilation processÂ²Â³:

1. -std=c++11: This option sets the standard of C++ to use. In this case, it is C++11, which is a version of C++ that introduced many new features and improvementsÂ¹.
2. -pthread: This option enables multithreading support with the POSIX threads library. This can improve the performance and concurrency of the programÂ².
3. -O3: This option sets the level of optimization to apply to the code. The higher the level, the more optimizations are performed, such as removing unused code, inlining functions, unrolling loops, etc. The level 3 is one of the highest levels of optimization and can make the code run faster but also increase the compilation time and memory usageÂ².
4. fastBPE/main.cc: This is the name of the source file to compile. It contains the main function and other definitions for fastBPEÂ².
5. -IfastBPE: This option adds a directory to the list of directories where g++ looks for header files. In this case, it is fastBPE, which contains some header files that are needed by fastBPEÂ².
6. -o fast: This option specifies the name of the output file to create. In this case, it is fast, which is an executable file that can run fastBPEÂ².


* sacremoses
``` bash
pip install sacremoses
```
* sklearn
``` bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Remember to set the environment variables `MOSES` and `FASTBPE` to the path of Moses and fastBPE respetively, as they will be required later.

For example:
``` bash
mkdir checkpoints
cd checkpoints
wget https://msramllasc.blob.core.windows.net/modelrelease/BioGPT/checkpoints/Pre-trained-BioGPT.tgz
tar -zxvf Pre-trained-BioGPT.tgz

## Example Usage
Use pre-trained BioGPT model in your code:
```python
import torch
from fairseq.models.transformer_lm import TransformerLanguageModel
m = TransformerLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
        "checkpoints/Pre-trained-BioGPT", 
        "checkpoint.pt", 
        "data",
        tokenizer='moses', 
        bpe='fastbpe', 
        bpe_codes="data/bpecodes",
        min_len=100,
        max_len_b=1024)
m.cuda()
src_tokens = m.encode("COVID-19 is")
generate = m.generate([src_tokens], beam=5)[0]
output = m.decode(generate[0]["tokens"])
print(output)
```

Use fine-tuned BioGPT model on KD-DTI for drug-target-interaction in your code:
```python
import torch
from src.transformer_lm_prompt import TransformerLanguageModelPrompt
m = TransformerLanguageModelPrompt.from_pretrained(
        "checkpoints/RE-DTI-BioGPT", 
        "checkpoint_avg.pt", 
        "data/KD-DTI/relis-bin",
        tokenizer='moses', 
        bpe='fastbpe', 
        bpe_codes="data/bpecodes",
        max_len_b=1024,
        beam=1)
m.cuda()
src_text="" # input text, e.g., a PubMed abstract
src_tokens = m.encode(src_text)
generate = m.generate([src_tokens], beam=args.beam)[0]
output = m.decode(generate[0]["tokens"])
print(output)
```

## Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Usage

BioGPT has also been integrated into the Hugging Face `transformers` library, and model checkpoints are available on the Hugging Face Hub.

You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we set a seed for reproducibility:

```python
from transformers import pipeline, set_seed
from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM
model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/biogpt")
tokenizer = BioGptTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/biogpt")
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
set_seed(42)
generator("COVID-19 is", max_length=20, num_return_sequences=5, do_sample=True)
```

Here is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:

```python
from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM
tokenizer = BioGptTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/biogpt")
model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/biogpt")
text = "Replace me by any text you'd like."
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
output = model(**encoded_input)
```

Beam-search decoding:

```python
import torch
from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM, set_seed

tokenizer = BioGptTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/biogpt")
model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/biogpt")

sentence = "COVID-19 is"
inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors="pt")

set_seed(42)

with torch.no_grad():
    beam_output = model.generate(**inputs,
                                 min_length=100,
                                 max_length=1024,
                                 num_beams=5,
                                 early_stopping=True
                                )
tokenizer.decode(beam_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```
