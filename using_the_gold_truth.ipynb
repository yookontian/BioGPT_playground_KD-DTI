This inhibition of enzyme activities was found to be dose-dependent and reversible. For MAO-A, the IC50 values are 15.2 +/- 1.3 microM psoralen and 9.0 +/- 0.6 microM isopsoralen. For MAO-B, the IC50 values are 61.8 +/- 4.3 microM psoralen and 12.8 +/- 0.5 microM isopsoralen. Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the inhibition data indicates that inhibition by both psoralen and isopsoralen is non-competitive for MAO-A. The Ki values were calculated to be 14.0 microM for psoralen and 6.5 microM for isopsoralen. On the other hand, inhibition by both psoralen and isopsoralen is competitive for MAO-B. The Ki values were calculated to be 58.1 microM for psoralen and 10.8 microM for isopsoralen. These inhibitory actions of psoralen and isopsoralen on rat brain mitochondrial MAO activities are discussed in relation to their toxicities and their potential applications to treat affective disorders.', 'triples': [{'drug': 'Psoralen', 'target': 'Monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A)', 'interaction': 'inhibitor'}, {'drug': 'Psoralen', 'target': 'Monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B)', 'interaction': 'inhibitor'}], 'pmid': '11169165'}\n"
